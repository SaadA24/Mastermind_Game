### About
This is a popular board game called Mastermind which I am currently creating in C++. It offers both human and computer game play.

## Mastermind - Rules of the game.
1) The codemaker (computer or player1/player2) generates a color sequence, with the code length initially set to 4 but adjustable for each new game.
2) The objective is for the codebreaker (player1/player2) to correctly guess the positions of the colors in the initial sequence.
3) After submitting your guesses of the sequence of colors, the game provides feedback on the accuracy of your guess.
4) Correct color and position in the code sequence are indicated by a small red marker and scores 1 point for the codebreaker.
5) Correct color but incorrect position results in a small white marker.
6) Incorrect color and position guesses earn the codemaker 1 point
7) The game is won when the codebreaker successfully guesses all colors in the code sequence and their correct positions.
8) Failure occurs if the codebreaker exhausts all attempts without accurately guessing the code maker's code sequence.
